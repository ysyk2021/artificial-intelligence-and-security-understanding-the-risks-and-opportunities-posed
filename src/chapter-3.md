In order to understand the role that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in cybersecurity, it is important to first understand the cybersecurity threat landscape. In this chapter, we will explore the common cybersecurity threats and types of cyber attacks that organizations face.

Common Cybersecurity Threats
----------------------------

Cybersecurity threats come in many forms, but some of the most common include:

* Malware: Malware is malicious software that is designed to harm or exploit computer systems. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
* Phishing: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that uses email or other communication methods to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information.
* Password attacks: Password attacks involve attempting to guess or steal passwords in order to gain access to systems or data.
* Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: DoS attacks involve sending a large volume of traffic to a server or network in order to overwhelm it and disrupt normal operation.
* Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: MITM attacks involve intercepting communications between two parties in order to eavesdrop on or modify the information being exchanged.

Types of Cyber Attacks
----------------------

Cyber attacks can take many different forms, including:

* Advanced persistent threats (APTs): APTs are persistent and targeted attacks that are typically carried out by organized groups or nation-states. APTs often involve multiple stages and can be difficult to detect and prevent.
* Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
* Insider threats: Insider threats involve employees or other insiders who abuse their access to privileged information in order to steal data or cause harm to the organization.
* Supply chain attacks: Supply chain attacks involve targeting third-party vendors or suppliers in order to gain access to a target organization's systems or data.
* Zero-day exploits: Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities in software or systems that are unknown to the vendor and can be exploited by attackers before a patch is released.

Understanding these common cybersecurity threats and types of attacks is essential for organizations seeking to protect themselves against potential threats. By staying informed about the latest techniques used by attackers, organizations can implement effective cybersecurity measures and mitigate the risks posed by cyber threats.
